# LRA Governance Design Index

This file is a router. It is not the full governance manual.

Canonical rule sources live under:

- `docs/governance/`
- `docs/architecture/`
- `docs/governance/repo-overlays/`
- `docs/workflows/`

Generated agent wrappers are derived from these modular sources.

Do not add large policy blocks directly to `DESIGN.md`. Add or update the
appropriate modular document instead.

## Canonical Source Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/governance/` | Authoring, dependency, decoration-box, model presentation, proof, extraction, notation, generated-agent, task-scope, refactoring, and validation standards. |
| `docs/governance/repo-overlays/` | Additive repository and repository-family overlays. |
| `docs/architecture/` | Ownership, repository layout, generated-file policy, sync architecture, build/render architecture, canonical YAML, and knowledge pipeline architecture. |
| `docs/workflows/` | Operational workflows for extraction, cleanup, wrapper sync, and audit/report phases. |
| `docs/archive/` | Retired or obsolete design assumptions retained for historical reference when needed. |

## Repository Overlay Router

Use exactly one repo overlay or repo-family overlay when generating or
interpreting repo-local agent rules.

| Repository | Overlay |
| --- | --- |
| `lra-common` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-common.md` |
| `lra-volume-i` through `lra-volume-viii` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-volume.md` |
| `lra-lean` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-lean.md` |
| `lra-nurbs` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-nurbs.md` |
| `lra-knowledge-explorer` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-knowledge-explorer.md` |
| `lra-numerical-analysis` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-numerical-analysis.md` |
| `lra-pdf-extractor` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-pdf-extractor.md` |
| `lra-reading-categorizer` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-reading-categorizer.md` |
| `lra-source-profiles` | `docs/governance/repo-overlays/lra-source-profiles.md` |

Repo overlays are additive. They refine the global rules for owned work, but
they do not fork or weaken global governance.

## Non-Negotiable Anchors

- Governance docs in `lra-governance` are canonical.
- Generated downstream files are not canonical.
- Downstream generated wrapper edits are emergency-only and must be ported
  upstream before the next regeneration.
- Generated wrapper sync is controlled, repo-selected, drift-checked, and
  full-replace only after review.
- Volume repos must not receive positive Lean, NURBS/Vulkan,
  numerical-analysis, PDF-extractor, or source-profile specialist rules.
- Canonical YAML is owned by `lra-governance`.
- Shared LaTeX infrastructure remains owned by `lra-common`.
- `Learning-Real-Analysis` (the former assembled monorepo) is retired; there is
  no fan-out sync and no volume-to-monorepo sync.
- Local model and Ollama output is advisory only.
- Do not invent predicates, labels, dependencies, or mathematical content.

## Maintenance Rule

When a new governance rule is added:

1. Put the rule in the smallest applicable modular document.
2. Update the relevant README or router if discovery would otherwise be hard.
3. Update repo overlays only when the rule changes repo-specific behavior.
4. Regenerate previews or run validation only when generated wrappers are in
   scope.

Large design narratives, obsolete assumptions, and historical notes belong in
`docs/archive/` or in a migration report, not in this router.
