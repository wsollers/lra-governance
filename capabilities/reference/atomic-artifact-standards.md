# Atomic Artifact Standards

These standards define repository-wide architectural invariants for
mathematical objects and figures. They apply to all volumes, split
repositories, future repositories, generators, extraction tools, and manual
authoring.

## Governing Principle

Every mathematical object that may appear as a node in the knowledge graph
shall exist as an independent repository artifact.

This means:

- one concept -> one definition;
- one theorem -> one theorem artifact;
- one proof -> one proof artifact;
- one figure -> one figure artifact;
- one capstone -> one capstone artifact;
- one graph node -> one stable label.

## Atomic Definitions

Every mathematical concept shall be introduced in its own definition
environment and shall possess its own unique label.

Canonical principle:

```text
One concept -> one definition -> one label.
```

Each mathematical concept introduced into the repository shall correspond to
exactly:

- one definition environment;
- one label;
- one knowledge-graph node;
- one extraction record.

Grouping multiple independent mathematical concepts into a single definition
environment is prohibited. This prohibition applies even when the concepts are
closely related, commonly taught together, or convenient to list together.

Allowed pattern:

```latex
\begin{definitionbox}{Reflexive Relation}
...
\label{def:reflexive-relation}
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{definitionbox}{Symmetric Relation}
...
\label{def:symmetric-relation}
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{definitionbox}{Transitive Relation}
...
\label{def:transitive-relation}
\end{definitionbox}
```

Forbidden pattern:

```latex
\begin{definitionbox}{Properties of Relations}
...
\label{def:relation-properties}
\end{definitionbox}
```

Reason: multiple independent concepts cannot share one repository identity.

When a source passage presents a coherent family of related definitions,
operations, cases, or constructions, the shared family may be introduced by a
short `remark*` block titled `Exposition`, but each independently nameable
concept in the family shall still receive its own definition environment and
stable label. Source-supported examples may follow the relevant definitions
when they improve understanding, but examples must not be invented merely to
fill a template.

A single parameterized definition that lets a symbol range over several named
operations, cases, or constructions does not satisfy atomicity when the source
states those named items separately. The parameterized schema may appear in
exposition, but it must not replace the atomic definition environments.

Definition labels shall be generated from normalized semantic titles, not from
raw OCR spans, page headers, prose fragments, or truncated source text.

When auditing existing content, multi-concept definitions shall be split into
atomic definitions, each new concept shall receive its own stable label, and
all references and extraction records shall be updated to the new labels.

## Atomic Figures

Every nontrivial TikZ figure shall exist as an independent figure source file.

Canonical principle:

```text
One figure -> one figure file.
```

All nontrivial TikZ figures shall be extracted into dedicated figure source
files. Embedded nontrivial `tikzpicture` environments in mathematical note,
proof, exercise, or exposition files are prohibited.

Figure source files shall contain only:

```latex
\begin{tikzpicture}
...
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Figure source files shall not contain:

- `figure` environments;
- captions;
- labels;
- surrounding explanatory text;
- document preambles;
- local color definitions.

Captions, labels, placement options, and explanatory prose belong at the
inclusion point.

Visual style, palette, and reusable TikZ keys are governed by
`tikz-style-guide.md`. Shared implementations belong in `lra-common`, not in
volume-local figure files.

Correct inclusion pattern:

```latex
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\input{figure-relation-dependency}
\caption{Dependency structure of relation properties.}
\label{fig:relation-dependency}
\end{figure}
```

## Trivial TikZ Exemption

The only permitted embedded `tikzpicture` environments are trivial diagrams.
A trivial diagram is a small, local visual mark that has no independent
mathematical identity, no caption, no label, no dependency-graph role, and no
reuse value.

Examples may include tiny inline arrows, ticks, or one-off visual separators.
Any diagram that explains a mathematical relation, construction, dependency,
map, commutative structure, graph, geometry, approximation, or proof idea is
nontrivial and shall be extracted.

When in doubt, extract the figure.

## Generator Requirements

Chapter, section, statement, and figure generators shall enforce these
invariants before emitting source:

- if requested definition content contains more than one independently
  nameable concept, generation shall split it into atomic definitions, using
  a short `remark*` Exposition block first when the concepts form a coherent
  family; if a safe split is not possible, generation shall stop and return a
  bundled-content notice;
- generators shall not satisfy a multi-definition request by emitting only a
  single parameterized umbrella definition;
- generators shall derive labels from normalized semantic titles, not raw OCR
  spans or prose fragments;
- generators may include short source-supported examples after definitions
  when they improve understanding, but must not invent examples merely to
  satisfy a pattern;
- if requested figure content contains a nontrivial TikZ diagram, generation
  shall emit a dedicated figure source file and an inclusion block;
- generated TikZ shall use the shared house style from `tikz-style-guide.md`
  and shall not emit local color systems or local style-guide copies;
- generators shall not create shared labels for bundled concepts;
- generators shall not embed nontrivial TikZ diagrams in note bodies.

## Extraction Requirements

Extraction tools shall treat each atomic definition and each figure inclusion
as an individually addressable artifact. Extraction records shall not merge
independent mathematical concepts into a single graph node. Figure source files
provide figure bodies only; figure labels are extracted from the inclusion
point.
