# Agent Task Index

Repository scope: repositories are independent. There is no assembled monorepo
(`Learning-Real-Analysis` is retired) and no volume-to-monorepo sync; each
`lra-volume-*` repo builds independently.

Governance scope: `lra-governance` is the master governance and script
repository; shared scripts, rules, prompts, schemas, workflows, and the
canonical YAML vocabulary (`predicates.yaml`, `notation.yaml`, `relations.yaml`)
belong here. They are not fan-out synced into leaf repositories; repos resolve
them through `LRA_GOVERNANCE_ROOT`, a sibling `../lra-governance` checkout, or
the build Docker image.

This index tells agents which authority to load for common LRA tasks. It is a
router, not a replacement for the referenced standards.

## Repository Scope Rule

When working from a local multi-repo checkout such as `F:\repos`, prefer the
canonical files in `lra-governance` for shared governance, architecture,
workflow, prompt, schema, tool, and overlay rules.

When an agent is running inside an isolated repository checkout, such as a
GitHub workflow or a single leaf repo clone without adjacent `lra-governance`,
use the build image or an explicit `lra-governance` checkout. Do not rely on
synced local copies under `docs/`.

Do not read every governance, workflow, architecture, schema, and prompt file by
default. Select the smallest file set that matches the task.

External repository references are marked with `[external:<repo>]`. They are
task inputs, not local `lra-governance` files.

## Governance Tool Resolution

Governance tool implementations are canonical in
`lra-governance/tools/governance/`.

Leaf repositories must not carry copied governance implementations. Volume build
wrappers and governance validators must resolve the canonical implementation
from `lra-governance` directly, not from legacy leaf-local validator copies.

When a task requires a governance validator:

1. Run the leaf-local wrapper if it exists.
2. If no wrapper exists and an adjacent `lra-governance` checkout exists, run
   the canonical tool from `lra-governance/tools/governance/`.
3. If neither is available, stop the task and report that `lra-governance` is
   not present, so governance compliance cannot be certified.

Wrappers may locate the canonical repo through `LRA_GOVERNANCE_ROOT`; otherwise
they should look for a sibling `lra-governance` checkout in a local multi-repo
workspace.

## Validator Targeting

Governance validators should keep full-volume acceptance as the gate. Use
scoped report modes only to reduce noise while working on a chapter or section.
Prefer named targets over hand-built paths when the validator supports them.

If the correct target is not obvious, run the validator's discovery mode first:

```powershell
python tools\governance\validate_volume.py <target-repo> --fail-on-errors
python tools\governance\audit_volume_layout.py --root <target-repo> --list-targets
python tools\governance\audit_proof_layout.py --root <target-repo> --list-targets
```

Then run the scoped check, for example:

```powershell
python tools\governance\validate_volume.py <target-repo> --chapter <chapter-name>
python tools\governance\audit_proof_layout.py --root <target-repo> --chapter <chapter-name> --section <topic-name> --strict
```

Before commit or push, run the unfiltered gate:

```powershell
python tools\governance\validate_volume.py <target-repo> --fail-on-errors
```

For generated notes, use `validate_volume.py` as the integrated acceptance
validator; use `--chapter` or scoped audit tools only when a task needs a
focused inventory or refactor report.

## Loading Discipline

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read this task index.
3. Read only the task's required docs, schema/data files, and tool help.
4. Inspect nearby source examples before editing.
5. Load optional files only when required files leave a concrete question
   unresolved.
6. Load constitution prompts only when the user explicitly asks for that
   prompted generation or audit mode.
7. Full-corpus governance reading is reserved for explicit governance audit or
   consolidation tasks.

## Schema Authority

Machine-checkable layout and artifact rules should live in structured schema
or data files. Prose docs should point to them instead of restating them.

- Statement and decoration block identity:
  `constitution/schema/block-registry.yaml`
- Required block matrix by artifact type:
  `constitution/schema/artifact-matrix.yaml`
- Volume, chapter, topic, proof folder, proof file, stub, capstone, and
  breadcrumb layout:
  `constitution/schema/file-schema.yaml`
- Audit response shape:
  `constitution/schemas/audit-report.json`
