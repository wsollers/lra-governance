# Generated File Policy

Agent instruction files and downstream compatibility wrappers should be treated
as generated artifacts.

Generated files must include:

- this header form:

```markdown
<!--
GENERATED FILE — DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.

Source repo: wsollers/lra-governance
Generated from:
- docs/governance/...
- docs/architecture/...
- docs/governance/repo-overlays/<overlay>.md

Regenerate from lra-governance.
Emergency downstream edits must be ported upstream.
-->
```

- source document list,
- source commit, revision, or hash when available,
- generation timestamp when useful and reproducibility does not require a
  stable preview,
- local-edit warning,
- pointer back to `lra-governance`.

Generated files are full-replaced outputs. Generators must support dry-run mode
and report drift before writing. Any future write mode must compare existing
downstream files with generated content before replacement.

Generated files must not contain secrets or machine-local credentials.

The generated file source list must be sufficient for a reviewer to identify
which global rules, architecture rules, and repo overlay were used.

Downstream generated wrappers are thin local delegates to canonical governance,
not copied implementations. Downstream wrapper edits are emergency-only and
must be ported upstream before regeneration. Generated wrappers should be
committed in downstream PRs or controlled downstream commits only after review.
