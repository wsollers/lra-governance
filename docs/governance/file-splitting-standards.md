# File Splitting Standards

Source sections: `DESIGN.md` sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 8, 9, 10.1, and 15.

## Atomicity

Each theorem-like environment shall contain exactly one independently
nameable mathematical object.

Every mathematical concept shall be introduced in its own definition
environment and shall possess its own unique label. Grouping multiple
independent mathematical concepts into a single definition environment is
prohibited.

Figure splitting is governed by `atomic-artifact-standards.md`: every
nontrivial TikZ figure exists as an independent figure source file, and
embedded nontrivial `tikzpicture` environments in note, proof, exercise, or
exposition files are prohibited. Figure visual style is governed by
`tikz-style-guide.md`.

## Chapter Layout

Chapters follow the canonical layout:

```text
<chapter>/
  index.tex
  chapter.yaml
  notes/
  proofs/
  exercises/
```

The chapter `index.tex` controls chapter-level inputs. Proof indexes control
proof input order. Exercise-vault material belongs under the top-level
`exercises/` tree, not under `proofs/`.

## File Names

Filenames are lowercase, hyphen-separated, ASCII, and free of LaTeX markup.
Proof filenames align with proof labels and theorem roots.

## Stability

Prefer high-fidelity preservation during refactors. Do not silently reorganize
mathematical files as part of unrelated edits.
